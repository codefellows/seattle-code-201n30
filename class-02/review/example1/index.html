        <p id="q1" style="background-color: aquamarine;color: black;">You are on a road and walking to the nearest town of Phanlin a mining
            town near the city of Waterdeep to meet up with your party after being seperated.
            As you travel along the path you hear cries for help coming from the woods
            that will take you off of the path and into the woods adjacent to the road.
            You know that there has been reports of gobilins in the area and one or two shouldn't be a problem for a
            warrior of your status but more than three could be a problem and possibly life threatning.
            Do you go and investigate the cries for help or continue down the path toward Phandalin to request aid
            from your party? please answer with either the word investigate or continue.
        </p>

        <p id="q2" style="background-color: blueviolet;color:black;"> You continue down the road with a sprint and after ten mintues
            of travel you finally make it to Phandalin to request aid from your party.
            They with out hesitation agree to assist you in investigating the cries.
            You lead them to the site where you heard the cries for help. You and your party find tracks
            that lead to a cave that has blood on the outside. There is the stinch of death coming from inside of the
            cave and you hear mischievous laughter coming from inside of the cave. You know that your party of three are
            formitable and couple of goblins should not be a problem with you all working together but there is
            a chance that they may kill the hostage that you heard earlier in the commotion. You could alternativly
            look for a more discreet entrance to the the cave and possibly surprise the goblins and assure the life of the
            hostage. Do you charge in bindly or take a more strategic route to ambush the goblins?
            please answer with either the word charge or ambush only.
        </p>
        <p id="q3" style="background-color: red;color: black;"> You charge into the fray with your party in tow. You burst into the cave with a bellowing
            battle cry and split a unsepecting goblin in half with your greatsword and
            bring there forces down by one. You do a quick count of your enemies and see that there
            is a total of 14 goblins in the main chamber of the cave with a
            path that leads deeper into another chamber that has a faint light emanating from inside.
            Your wizard decides to shot a fire bolt that kills five goblins at once. One of the goblins witnessing
            this, frantically runs further inward toward the chamber and screams 'Clarg!.' before
            he gets futher into the inner chamber, The Ranger in your party shoots a arrow right into his throat
            killing the goblin instantly. A moment later you and your party begin to hear a rumbling coming from futher
            in the cave. the goblins begin to surroud you and your party and a large 9 foot tall Bugbear emerges ready to attack
            you and your party are back to back whispering your next course of action. You could either delegate your attacks
            and dwindle down the goblins so you can focus on the bugbear without fear of interruption
            on the other hand you could concentrate your attacks on the larger Bugbear goblins tend to be cowards and
            run when there learder is deafted. Do you delegate your attacks or concentrate on the larger more formitable
            opponet? please answer with either the word delegate or concentrate only.
        </p>
        <p id="q4" style="background-color: black;color: beige;">It takes longer than you would like to dwindle down the goblins while avoiding the devastating attacks of the
            bugbear. You all manage to take out the last goblin and give some damage to the bugbear with the party taking minium damage.
            But are exhaused from the length of the battle the Bugbear appears to be cornered and point to you and shouts
            'you must be the leader of this adventuring party. I challenge you to a fight to the death just you and me
            on my honor as a warrior of the fey realms' your party is strictly against it saying that this is a
            act of desperation and if we attack together we can be back in Phandalin in time for happy hour at the tavern.
            You could accept his challenge and possibly avoid your party from sustaining injury as you are the vanguad of the
            party you are most likly to survive a hit from the beast or, deny his offer and take in unison, there is strenth in numbers after all.
            Do you accept or deny the Bugbears challenge? please answer with either the words accept or deny only.
        </p>

        <p id="m1"> You investigate the cries for help you see a unconcious young man on the ground. As you run
            to her aid you hear ruffling in the bushes directly next to her. A goblin comes out and challenges you. you fight and
            easily mow him down but are surprised by another goblin that wounds you from behind. You turn going for into a immediate counter attack and slay your second goblin.
            only to notice there are three more with there bows trained on to you. You move on reflex and they fire killing you and leaving the young man to his fate.
        </p>
        <p id="m2"> You and your party decide to go and look for a alternative
            means of entering the cave. The Ranger of your party knows the area well enough to know that
            this particular cave has a back entrance you can use to sneak in. You follow and see her stop suddenly
            and before you can react she is shot in the eye by arrow killing her.You and the remaining wizard in your party
            are unsure of the trajectory so, off impulse you the wizard pull out your weapons prepared to battle for your lives.
            There is a moment of silence the air thick with the fresh smell of blood comming from your fallen commorade. As the wizard begins
            one of his spells he is met with an arrow in his throat killing him before your eyes. In shock you charge blindly slashing at trees thinking
            they are above. An arrow greets you achiles tendon immobilizing you and finally an arrow to back laying the killing blow to sending you
            to meet your party in the after life.
         </p>
        <p id="m3"> You and your party go for an all out assult on the Bugbear known as Clarg.
            The ranger his him with one of her arrows hiting an eye and blinding him. Giving you the opprtunity to attack and wound him.
            he reacts by attacking you but you move out the way just in time for the wizard to hit him with a lightning bolt paralyzing
            the bugbear for a time you go in for a killing blow hearing the cries of your allies. you turn to see that without your protection
            as the vangurad they where flanked and injured with the wizard being completly killed by a thrown spear. you rush to add your last ally
            only to be blindsided by an attack from the recently recovered bugbear killing you as you tell the ranger to run with your final breath.
        </p>
        <p id="m4"> You decide to accept the bugbears challenge on one condition regardless of the outcome he allow
            your party to go free. He accepts and you begin combat. You exchange blow after blow with each attack more devastating than the last.
            as you go in for an attack that chops off right arm that holds his weapon. He as a reaction moves his weapon from his right arm to the
            left immediatly counter attacking. You fall to ground going unconcious for a split second. As you begin to get up you see Clarg has renigged
            on his aggreement and turns to you allies with intent to attack. As he moves toward them you leap up and decapitate him before he reacheas them.
            You say something cool and then immediatly pass out from exhaustion. You awaken in Phandalin to your party
            scolding you on your reckless behavior they tell you that you are in the home of the mayor of the town who healed you
            after saving his sons life. They have a party in your honor and recieve a sizable reward for your efforts.
