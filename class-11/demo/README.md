## PROBLEM DOMAIN

Goat Vote Co is trying to decide which goats to breed from their R&D department so they can continue producing the best goats on earth. They asked you to make a web page that they can run at a kiosk at the front entrance of their campus. Whenever an employee walks by, the employee can vote for 2 goats displayed that they think should be the next big thing. After a week of collecting data, they would like some nice graphs to visualize the results.

To make this data collection project maximally effective, Goat Vote wants you to build an app that displays two of their goats side by side, without favoring any single goat.

You will need to store each anonymous vote, calculate totals, and visually display the results.

To keep the product selection process as untainted as possible, you have been instructed to not allow any results to be shown to users until there have been a total of 15 selections made.

The marketing team is not only interested in the total number of clicks, but also the percentage of times that an item was clicked when it was shown. So, you'll also need to keep track of how many times each image is displayed and do the calculations.
