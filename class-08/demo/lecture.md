# CSS & Flex

## Display

- A property tell our elements how much space they should take up
- The way the content is lined up on the page
- Block level elements take up the entire width
- Inline tells the elements to sit directly next to each other
- Inline-block combination of the two, allows us to size things, so that our items can sit next to each other

## Flex

- A value on the display property
- Flex runs on an axis
- When we assign the parent element the display property value of flex it define that element as a *flex container*
- The elements within become *flex-items*
- Flex is helpful for responsive design

### Flex-direction

- Property name
- We're going to reference this as row / column (the values)
- Establishes the axis:
  - row is horizontal / x axis
  - column / vertical is the y axis

### Justify-content

- Property name
- We manage the whitespace / negative space
- Helps us to control how the additional space is distributed
- Based upon our defined direction

### Align-Items

- This handles how elements are positioned across our opposite axis

### Flex Wrap

- Handles Overflow content
- Similar to word wrap where it will push content that doesn't fit onto a new line (in this case row or column based on our specified direction)
